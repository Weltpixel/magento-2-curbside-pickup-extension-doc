                        <h2>6 Fully Customizable Tracking Page Designs</h2>
                        <p>
You’ve worked hard to convert your customer so don't send them off into the void of a confusing third party courier page or give them a generic tracking number. Ensure they get the experience they deserve.
</p>
<p>
 With WeSupply, you can create a branded tracking experience for the customer so they never have to leave your store!
</p>
<p>
 Just pick the design, add your logo, set up your brand’s colors and start building the best possible experience for users. You can even insert fixed assets, custom HTML as well as CSS.
</p>
<p>
Finally, ensure that the shopping momentum is used to its full potential by exploiting cross-sell opportunities to display recommended products, promotions and other calls to action.
</p>
<h2>Omnichannel Tracking</h2>
<p>
If you’re using an omnichannel solution, it’s probably working great at securing your sales, however, it probably doesn’t help you out much when it comes to shipment tracking. The post purchase experience in general is something that’s easily omitted.
</p>
<p>
 WeSupply centralizes orders from the website, marketplace, applications, POS, OMS and WMS which creates one seamless experience.
</p>
<p>
 This means that customers will always have one reliable portal to check the status of their order, regardless of where they purchase it.

<h2>HOW TO INSTALL THE MAGENTO 2 BRANDED TRACKING PAGE EXTENSION.</h2>

Before installing the Branded Tracking Page Magento 2 Extension Free Trial, please check the extension compatibility.

</p>
<p>
Step 2:
Copy the extension files to below paths of your magento 2 instance. If ‘app/code/WeSupply’ folder is missing, please create it manually:
app/code/WeSupply/Toolbox
</p>
<p>
Step 3:
Access the root of your magento 2 project from command line and run the following commands:
    <p>
      <strong>php bin/magento module:enable WeSupply_Toolbox --clear-static-content</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>php bin/magento setup:upgrade</strong>
</p>
<p>

<h2>HOW TO UPGRADE THE EXTENSION.</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
    Step 1: Remove extension code under app/code/WeSupply/Toolbox before adding the new extension files. The extension may be refactored and old unused files may cause random issues so it's best to only keep the latest version of the files.
  </p>
  <p>
    Step 2: Follow normal installation instructions above.
