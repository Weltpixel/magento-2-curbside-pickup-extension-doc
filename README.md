    <h2>What is Store Pickup for Magento 2 and why do you need it?</h2>
                        <p>
                       In the age of e-commerce, BOPIS has become a common contraction for "buy online pick up in store" and few things have trended as much on retail shelves since this business model became popular. Pickup solutions are now most popular with grocery stores around the world because they allow customers to easily find their products when it suits them without waiting at home or sitting through delivery times.
                       </p>
                       <p>
With the WeSupply Magento 2 Store Pickup extension, once the order is ready, the customer is notified via SMS or Email that it's available for pickup. All they need to do once they've received the message is to head over to the guest service and verify a "one time PIN code" before picking up their order, improving the user experience and helping store owners prepare for customer arrival efficiently.

    <h2>What is a Curbside Pickup Solution and why do you need it?</h2>
<p>
Curbside pickup has given many retailers the opportunity to continue operating and serve customers while practicing social distancing. Even as some stores reopen, other regions are tightening restrictions, yet people remain cautious due to COVID-19 pandemic fears which means that curbside pick up will be a vital option for quite some time - surging 208% in just 3 weeks from last year’s statistics!
</p>
<p>
A large number of stores have begun adopting Curbside Pickup, meaning your competition may already have a head start. With WeSupply, you can:

    <h2>Buy Online Return in Store - Drive foot traffic and more revenue to your store via in-store returns</h2>
<p>
Brick and mortar stores allow customers the opportunity to return items with ease, which provides a great advantage over competitors that are strictly available online. This is because 62% of shoppers are more likely to shop if they can do so in a store location rather than exclusively on their computer or mobile device.
</p>
<p>
The physical presence also offers opportunities for retailers like you to not only get them through your doors but also delight these visitors by showcasing new products as well as promotional deals that could result in additional purchases from this customer again!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In store returns give brick and mortar locations an edge over their competitive counterparts who solely exist online such as Amazon Prime; according to recent research, 62% of consumers will be motivated enough by easy access ways (brick & mortars) when shopping.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          With WeSupply, this process can be streamlined by:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                         <li>
                          <strong>Listing all the stores that are able to accept the return</strong> - This clears up confusion, helps the customer avoid useless trips and decreases the number of support tickets you receive.
                         </li>
                         <li>
<strong>Pre-approving returns</strong> - This helps avoid hassle at the store address - The customer just walks in, drops the item off and receives their refund.
                         </li>
                       </ul>
